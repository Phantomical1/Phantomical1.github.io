            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>As a recent high school graduate with an anti-school mindset, going into college was a bit of a gamble. I
                didn't know exactly what I wanted to do, but I certainly wanted to find something. With a long while of
                thinking, I narrowed my options down to three things...</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Aerospace Engineering... which is much too costly, money being a huge factor on what you can do in
                    life as of now. Additionally, my scholarship applying game was rather lacking.</li>
                <li>Computer Science... which took me a semester of doing to tap out on. I learnt a lot of great things
                    that I plan to continue applying and learning as a side hobby and potential secondary flow of cash,
                    as this may prove beenficial for. Ultimately I found myself losing interest in computers the more it
                    became 'my future' and my entire focus in education. School is a great way to learn, but sometimes
                    not everyone can learn everything in such an environment.</li>
                <li>Psychology... which is what I'm more or less landing on at long last. It was the third of my options
                    I had always considered, and unfortunately the last I'e come to try. Specifically, I'm taking the
                    Behavioral Sciences program to eventually major in a psychology field. I find the study of the human
                    mind to be very fascinating, and can see myself blending said studies with the knowledge I've
                    developed in coding.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Class wise, I've taken an introductory Webdev class in HTML and CSS, as well as an introductory C# class.
                On top of this, a computer basics class has been taken. I will not be furthering my knowledge in any of
                these areas through classes, but intend to self-teach myself alongside my regular education in pursuit
                of a psychology degree.</p>

            <h2>Projects</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Three River Retrievers: A 'final-esk' project for my basic Website Development course. It features
                    various less base-level functions, such as window scaling based on the device's screen size as well
                    as prominent elements like a carasoul and 'scrolling gallery' of sorts.</li>
                <li>Potential Dog Breeding Website: A friend's family found themselves in need of a website, and I've
                    offered up some assistance in doing so. Details on said project would be included if it goes
                    through, though ideally elements would be taken from the Three River Retrievers in order to save
                    time and repurpose previous ideas. Such demonstrates a useful skillset of being able to
                    adjust/change a website from minute changes to larger, full revamps.</li>
